### Plans for the Fellowship

Robin the researcher:

> So thanks to the Carpentries I can now use Version Control and do some testing.
> But how should I structure all my scripts to make parts reusable 
> and make version control and testing easier?

**Goal: increase understanding of why, when and how of software packaging**

* Lack of guidance around how to structure code as grows larger
    * No separation of reusable components from analysis notebooks/scripts
    * Impedes application of testing, autogen'd docs, versioning
* Packaging up reusable components should help;
    * Separate linear analysis/narrative from implementation of core func

---
### Activity 1: RSE discussion workshop (0.5d)

* How/when to introduce researchers to packaging
* Guidelines for splitting code/data between data repo, analysis repo and package repos and linking them for reproducibility

Advertise via UK RSE and N8 CIR

---
### Activities 2 & 3: R & Python packaging workshops (1d each)

* Motivation for creating packages
* How and when to migrate existing code to package
* Handling dependencies
* Versioning
* Incorporating test suites and auto-generating docs (basics)
* CI for testing and documentation (basics)
* Checklists!

---
### Activity 4: auditing packages for PIs

* Motivation
* Tools/concepts/language
* Needs to also cover basics of version control
* Checklists

---
## Outputs

* Open materials from R, Python and PI workshops 
    * allows TUOS and others to re-run
* Reflective SSI blog post (possibly paper) from workshop for RSEs
    * To prompt discussions at a larger scale
* Introductory material for Reprohacks
    * How to evaluate software quality
